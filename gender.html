            <h2>This chart compares suicide rates in men (shown on the y-axis) versus rates in women (shown on the x-axis). <br> <br>
                Globally, suicide rates in men are just over twice as high as for women. In 2017 – as we see in the visualization – the global suicide rate for women was 6.3 deaths per 100,000; for men, it was just over twice that figure at 13.9 per 100,000.</h2>
